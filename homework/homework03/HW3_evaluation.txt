A couple of comments:
problem 7.6: The real problem with regression testing is that because you
   are most often testing existing functionality to make sure they aren't
   broken by what's been changed/added, you may miss other system-level
   problems that crop up for which no tests have been written as yet.  You
   are close, though....
problem 8.16: The absolute best measure of Agile success is the satisfaction
   of the customer.  "If you're happy, then I'm happy...."  Your answer is
   good, though!  :)
problem 8.18: ACK!! You didn't put an answer for this one...
problem 9.17: OOOO! Good example!

Excellent answers, even the ones with comments.

Great job on this final assignment!
