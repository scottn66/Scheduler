Very good job on this assignment!

chapter 2 #6, I'm not sure that technology architecture was generally
neglected prior to Agile, but it is true that it wasn't as much of a
priority to *managers*....  :)

chapter 2 #19, good point!  Frustration with management can be a real
morale killer!

Keep up the good work ~ you have set yourselves a high bar!
