A few comments:
Problem 4.16: There is no official role called "requirements gatherer", but
   technically that is one of the duties of the product owner, so partially
   correct answer here.
Problem 4.20: Partially correct answer here; the "responsibility" for test
   is actually under the role of the technical lead or software architect.
Problem 5.3: Missed the second half of the question ~ what should be done?
   Obviously the answer is "break them down into smaller stories"...  :)
Problem 6.16: Your answer is not wrong, but a possibly more complete way of
   looking at it is that it involves identifying a similar or related task
   that everyone on the team is familiar with and assigning a point value to
   it based on the knowledge of that task.  In other words, comparing that
   task to a 'baseline'.
