Preliminary Design Document Evaluation
========================================

Evaluation:
   Nice work on this assignment!  Full credit for your work here, and it
   looks like this will be VERY useful!  I can't wait to try it out.

   Just a couple of comments to note:

=========
Section 1.1:  Good description ~ clear, with specific focus.

Section 1.2:  Great start on the user stories ~ these are epics, of course,
   but should be easy to break down into snaller parts.

Section 1.3:  Great diagram to describe the preliminary look and feel of the
   project!

Section 1.4:  Awesome job on the schedule and description!  Very complete and
   detailed, and you have already flagged what you have completed.

Section 1.5:  This is fine.

Other General Comments:
   Nothing to add here..... excellent work!
